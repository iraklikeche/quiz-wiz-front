# quiz-wiz

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

# Overview

```
<p>Quiz Wiz is an interactive quiz application designed to offer users a fun and engaging way to test their knowledge across various categories and difficulty levels. Users can participate in quizzes either as guests or by creating an account. Registered users have the advantage of tracking their progress, viewing detailed quiz results, and the limitation of taking each quiz only once to ensure fairness. Guests, on the other hand, can take quizzes as many times as they like without their progress being saved.</p>
